An class management system written in javascript, html and css. Uses nodejs for the backend and
pugjs for templating.

### Setup
Install the required node packages using:
`npm install packages.json`
from the project root directory.

If you're using mysql from MariaDB, then set up the server using the command:

`sudo mysql mariadb_setup.sql`

Otherwise, use the command:

`sudo mysql server_setup.sql`

And that's it! Enjoy :)
